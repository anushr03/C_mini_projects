# Notes for Programming Language C

- **Method** like a container in which we put our code

- **Variables** are essentially like containers.

    - Printing different data types with `printf`. All these are **format specifiers**
        - `%s`: printing strings
        - `%d`: printing integers
        - `%f`: printing doubles
    - Data types
        - `Int`: Integer
        - `double`: Decimal number
        - `char`: Characters
        - `char[]`: We can create a `String` using this. Technically called an Array. *Not techincally a Data type*

- `printf` is a function. 

    - `\n` to add a newline
